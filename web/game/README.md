# Game Directory

## How to Add Your Godot Game

This directory will contain your Godot game export files.

### Steps:

1. **Export from Godot**:
   - Open your Godot project
   - Go to Project → Export
   - Select "Web" or "HTML5" export
   - Export to a temporary location (e.g., Desktop/game_export/)

2. **Copy Files Here**:
   - Copy ALL files from your Godot export to this directory
   - Typical files include:
     - `index.html`
     - `index.wasm`
     - `index.pck`
     - `index.js`
     - `index.icon.png` (optional)

3. **Test**:
   - Run your application locally
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/game.html`
   - The game should load in the iframe

### Current Status:
❌ No game files present - placeholder only

Once you add the Godot export files, the game will be playable at `/game.html`
